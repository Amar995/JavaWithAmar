Aggregation in Java<\/h2>\n<p>We call <strong>aggregation<\/strong> those relationships whose <strong>objects have an independent lifecycle, but there is ownership<\/strong>, and child objects cannot belong to another parent object. <\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take an example of a cell phone and a cell phone battery. A single battery can belong to a phone, but if the phone stops working, and we delete it from our database, the phone battery will not be deleted because it may still be functional. So in aggregation, while there is ownership, objects have their own lifecycle.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/howtodoinjava.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/aggregation.jpg\" alt=\"aggregation\" width=\"454\" height=\"102\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7804\" srcset=\"https:\/\/howtodoinjava.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/aggregation.jpg 454w, https:\/\/howtodoinjava.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/aggregation-300x67.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a id=\"composition\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>3.

This difficulty is caused in part because aggregation and composition are subsets of association, meaning they are specific cases of association.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7806\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7806\" style=\"width: 368px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/howtodoinjava.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Association-Aggregation-and-Composition-Relationship.jpg\" alt=\"Association, Aggregation and Composition Relationship\" width=\"378\" height=\"378\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7806\" srcset=\"https:\/\/howtodoinjava.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Association-Aggregation-and-Composition-Relationship.jpg 378w, https:\/\/howtodoinjava.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Association-Aggregation-and-Composition-Relationship-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/howtodoinjava.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Association-Aggregation-and-Composition-Relationship-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7806\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Association, Aggregation and Composition Relationship<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Drop me your questions in comments section.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Learning !!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Association, aggregation and composition are three relationships which classes can have in object oriented programming.
