A <strong>block statement is generally used to group together several statements<\/strong>, so they can be used in a situation that requires you to use a single statement. In some situations, you can use only one statement. If you want to use more than one statement in those situations, you can create a block statement by placing all your statements inside braces, which would be treated as a single statement. You can think of a block statement as a compound statement that is treated as one statement. <\/p>\n<p>An example of block statement is given below.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n{ \/\/block start\r\n        int var = 20;\r\n        var++;\r\n} \/\/block end\r\n<\/pre>\n<h3>Scope of variables<\/h3>\n<p>Please note that all the variables declared in a block statement can only be used within that block. In other words, you can say that all variables declared in a block have local scope. <\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n{ \/\/block start\r\n        int var = 20;\r\n        var++;\r\n} \/\/block end\r\n\/\/ A compile-time error. var has been declared inside a block and\r\n\/\/ so it cannot be used outside that block\r\nSyetem.out.println(var);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Similarily, you can also nest a block statement inside another block statement. All the variables declared in the enclosing blocks (outer blocks) are available to the enclosed blocks (inner blocks). However, the variables declared in the enclosed inner blocks are not available in enclosing outer blocks.<\/p>\n<h3>During object creation<\/h3>\n<p>Another thing which may interest you that block statements need not to be only inside methods. You can write them as other class members such as class variables and methods.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\npublic class MyDemoAction \r\n{\r\n\tprivate Interger variable = 10;\r\n\r\n\tpublic MyDemoAction(){\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;MyDemoAction Constructor&quot;);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\/\/Non-static block statement\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tstatic {\r\n\t\t\/\/Static block statement\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprivate void someMethod() {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;HowToDoInJava.com&quot;);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n<\/pre>\n<div class=\"noticeboxesde bluenoticebox\">Please note that when block statements are declared in such way, non-static blocks will be executed everytime an instance of class is created. Static block will be execute only once when class is loaded by JVM clas loaders (Much like other static variables present at class level).<\/div>\n<p>That&#8217;s all you will need to know about block staments in java.
