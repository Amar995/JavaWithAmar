Why the traditional <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Relational_database\" title=\"Relational database\">relational databases<\/a><\/strong> are loosing the battle with their new competitor like MongoDB. Why they are so popular now-a-days. Why?<\/p>\n<h3>Why NoSQL?<\/h3>\n<p>Interactive applications have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, and so have the data management needs of those apps. Data is <strong>becoming easier to capture and access through third parties<\/strong> such as Facebook, D&#038;B, and others. Personal user information, geo location data, social graphs, user-generated content, machine logging data, and sensor-generated data are just a few examples of the ever-expanding array of data being captured. And the <strong>use of the data is rapidly changing<\/strong> the nature of communication, shopping, advertising, entertainment, and relationship management. Apps that don\u2019t leverage it quickly will quickly fall behind.<\/p>\n<p>Developers want a very <strong>flexible database<\/strong> that easily accommodates new data types and isn\u2019t disrupted by content structure changes from third-party data providers. Much of the <strong>new data is unstructured and semi-structured<\/strong>, so developers also need a database that is capable of efficiently storing it. Unfortunately, the rigidly defined, schema-based approach used by relational databases makes it impossible to quickly incorporate new types of data, and is a poor fit for unstructured and semi-structured data. NoSQL provides a data model that maps better to these needs.<\/p>\n<h3>Why MongoDB?<\/h3>\n<p>MongoDB is an <strong>open-source document database<\/strong> that provides <strong>high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling<\/strong> across a configurable set of systems that function as storage nodes.<\/p>\n<div class=\"noticeboxesde bluenoticebox\"><br \/>\nMongoDB shines because of its ease of use, whether a developer is using it in a large-scale application that spans hundreds or thousands of nodes, or in a single-server application that has no need for scale.<br \/>\n<\/div>\n<p>If you remember that in <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/JSON\" title=\"JSON\">JSON<\/a><\/strong> we store the information in key-value pairs like this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n{\r\n   name : &quot;lorem&quot;,\r\n   address : &quot;ipsum\r\n}\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>MongoDB stores all data in documents, which are JSON-style data structures composed of field-and-value pairs. MongoDB stores documents on disk in the BSON serialization format. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/bsonspec.org\/\" title=\"bson\">BSON<\/a><\/strong> is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON. These documents can be simple documents as above and can also be complex documents such as below:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: java; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n{\r\n    id: x,\r\n    name: y,\r\n    other: z,\r\n    multipleArray: [\r\n        {lab1: &quot;A&quot;,  lab2: &quot;B&quot;, lab3:&quot;C&quot;},\r\n        {lab1: &quot;AB&quot;, lab2: &quot;BB&quot;, lab3:&quot;CB&quot;},\r\n        {lab1: &quot;AC&quot;, lab2: &quot;BC&quot;, lab3:&quot;CC&quot;}\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Most user-accessible data structures in MongoDB are documents, including:<\/p>\n<p>-> All database records.<br \/>\n-> Query selectors, which define what records to select for read, update, and delete operations.<br \/>\n-> Update definitions, which define what fields to modify during an update.<br \/>\n-> Index specifications, which define what fields to index.<br \/>\n-> Data output by MongoDB for reporting and configuration, such as the output of the server-status and the replica set configuration document.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that there are some <strong>limitations of MongoDB<\/strong> as well when comparing to relational databases:<\/p>\n<p>a) It doesn&#8217;t support Joins<br \/>\nb) It doesn&#8217;t support Transactions<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all for this little introductory post.
