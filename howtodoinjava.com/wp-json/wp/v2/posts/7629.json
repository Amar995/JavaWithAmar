In this tutorial, we will learn about how Gradle is different from other build automation tools and then we will see one simple example for installing and using gradle.<\/p>\n<pre>Table of Contents\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#gradle-vs-maven\">Gradle vs. other build tools<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"#install-gradle\">Installing Gradle<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"#write-gradle-script\">Writing simple Gradle script<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"#execute-gradle\">Executing Gradle script<\/a><\/pre>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/howtodoinjava.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Gradle-1024x351.png\" alt=\"Gradle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"351\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7630\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a name=\"gradle-vs-maven\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Gradle vs. other build tools<\/h2>\n<p>If you have worked with maven, you know that you cannot generate more than one artifact (jar or war file etc.) from one build file (pom.xml). If you want to generate two jar files from signle <code>src<\/code> folder, then you will have to create possibly two projects in maven. This is one of the difficulties with existing build tools.<\/p>\n<p>Other build tools, for years, had been used for compiling and packaging software. But with changing industry requirements, projects involve large and diverse software stacks, incorporate multiple programming languages, and apply a broad spectrum of testing strategies. With the rise of agile practices, builds have to support early integration of code as well as frequent and easy delivery to test and production environments.<\/p>\n<p>Other tools fall short in meeting these goals and this where Gradle comes into picture. It draws on lessons learned from established tools and takes their best ideas to the next level. <\/p>\n<p>Gradle&#8217;s ability to manage dependencies isn&#8217;t limited to external libraries. As your project grows in size and complexity, you\u2019ll want to organize the code into modules with clearly defined responsibilities. Gradle provides powerful support for defining and organizing multiproject builds, as well as modeling dependencies between projects.<\/p>\n<p>Gradle build scripts are declarative, readable, and clearly express their intention. Writing code in Groovy instead of XML, sprinkled with Gradle\u2019s build-by-convention philosophy, significantly cuts down the size of a build script and is far more readable.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"install-gradle\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Installing Gradle<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>As a prerequisite, make sure you\u2019ve already installed the JDK 6 or higher. <\/li>\n<li>Getting started with Gradle is easy. You can download the distribution directly from the Gradle homepage at <a href=\"https:\/\/gradle.org\/install\/\">https:\/\/gradle.org\/gradle-download\/<\/a>. Distribution comes with source, binaries, documents and examples.<\/li>\n<li>Extract downloaded zip file at some place into your development machine. Now set the environment variable <code>GRADLE_HOME<\/code> to gradle directory.<\/li>\n<li>Add <code>GRADLE_HOME\/bin <\/code> folder to <code>PATH<\/code> environment variable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You should be able to run <code>gradle -v<\/code> command from command line. If it happens and you get the output, you are ready to use gradle into your project. Output of above command will look like this:<\/p>\n<pre>------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGradle 2.14.1\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBuild time:   2016-07-18 06:38:37 UTC\r\nRevision:     d9e2113d9fb05a5caabba61798bdb8dfdca83719\r\n\r\nGroovy:       2.4.4\r\nAnt:          Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.6 compiled on June 29 2015\r\nJVM:          1.6.0_33 (Sun Microsystems Inc. 20.8-b03)\r\nOS:           Windows 7 6.1 x86<\/pre>\n<p><a name=\"write-gradle-script\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Writing simple Gradle script<\/h2>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s write a simle gradle script and try to run it.
